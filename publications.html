        <p class = "researchIntro"> During the summer of 2023, under the mentorship of Professor Aaron Kim of Stony Brook University, I researched the statistical and mathematical approaches to pricing
        options. Options prices are valuated on both the motion and the price of the asset price itself. A way to topologically "predict" these motions is through both the concept of brownian motion 
        and the Monte Carlo Simulation. Each of these ideas utilize the idea of a random variable to model the inherent unpredictability of the financial market. Until recently, however, these variables
        were allocated to either a Gaussian distribution or a Normal Inverse Gaussian distribution. After researching the literature on financial and quantitative analysis, I discovered the nuanced usage
of the Variance-Gamma distribution to visualize the stock market and eventually price the options chain with optimal accuracy. During the summer of my work with Professor Kim, I wrote weekly reports on 
my findings utilizing the R coding language and ML regression techniques. Download a summary of those reports below and watch out for a finalized thesis soon!</p>

        <p class = "researchIntro"> Before this more extensive research, my interests in finance sparked an initial venture into quantitative analysis with a web app. Utilizing a Normal Inverse Gaussian 
        Distribution to manage risks and historical stock movement, I generated an efficient frontier of the Dow Jones Index given an input for the range of historical data, outputting the optimal
weights of each asset to minimize risk and maximize return.</p>
