        <p class = "unisonIntro"> During the summer of 2023, under the mentorship of Professor Aaron Kim of Stony Brook University, I researched the statistical and mathematical approaches to pricing
        options. Options prices are valuated on both the motion and the price of the asset price itself. A way to topologically "predict" these motions is through both the concept of brownian motion 
        and the Monte Carlo Simulation. Each of these ideas utilize the idea of a random variable to model the inherent unpredictability of the financial market. Until recently, however, these variables
        were allocated to either a Gaussian distribution or a Normal Inverse Gaussian distribution. After researching the literature on financial and quantitative analysis, I discovered the nuanced usage
of the Variance-Gamma distribution to visualize the stock market and eventually price the options chain with optimal accuracy. During the summer of my work with Professor Kim, I wrote weekly reports on 
my findings utilizing the R coding language and ML regression techniques. Download a summary of those reports below and watch out for a finalized thesis soon!</p>
