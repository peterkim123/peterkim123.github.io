        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p class = "resultsIntro"> RESULTS is a bipartisan grassroots organization that advocates directly to politicians and world leaders to end poverty. Through education, health, and economic policy, I discussed bill sponsorships and writings with numerous U.S. Senators and Representatives. I'm the only high school RESULTS fellow and one of the only high school members, period. As the Action Network Manager of RESULTS-Austin, I organized a interstate advocacy conference (Texas and Oklahoma) with over 50 advocates. National tuberculosis, health, and housing experts and doctors spoke at the conference and more than 20 editorial pieces were generated. </p>
